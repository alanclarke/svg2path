svg2path
=========

This is a simple tool to convert svg files into paths. It compliments [pathicons](http://github.com/eckoit/pathicon) very well. You can also use the paths with [raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/icons/) directly.


Install
-------

    npm install svg2path -g

Usage
-----

    svg2path some.svg

This will create a file some.path

    svg2path http://thenounproject.com/categories/people/

Creates a path file for each of icons in the people category.

	
Icon Sheets
-----------

You can build up a an icon sheet to be used in an application. This is a sheet.json file where the name of the icon is the key and the path is the value.

    svg2path http://thenounproject.com/categories/people/ -s sheet.json

This will write all the icons to the sheet.json file.
